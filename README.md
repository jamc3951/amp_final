To Run: 'roslaunch policy.launch'

Main Components:

- PolicyServer.py: ROS node that accesses data from .pkl, runs MCTS. Communication via msg/srv.
- Controller.py: ROS node, runs RRT based algorithms
   -To change subproblem run, change 'self.subproblem' in Controller.py
- rrt.py: Contains all rrt algorithms for solving and plotting
